# Disjoint Sets
Western University - CS3340B Analysis of Algorithms - Winter 2021 - Assignment 2

Efficient implementation of disjoint set (union-find) data structure.  Supports make_set(), union(), and find() operations.

Time complexity is O(m log* n) for a sequence of m operations, n of which are make_set operations.  In practice, this is linear time.

## Usage
* `make` - compiles program
* `make test` - runs program using "infile" as input
* `make clean` - clean up when finished
